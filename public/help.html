    <h2>2: CSS modifications</h2>
    <p>
      Most of my CSS is as jss inside of each component. This gets compiled down
      to classes named jss# to avoid collisions.
    </p>
    <p>
      I didn't use any css templates, but I did include a theme modified from
      <a href="https://react-theming.github.io/create-mui-theme/"
        >react-theming.github.io/create-mui-theme</a
      >. It is less of a css template and more colors and sizes and whatnot in
      plain json. The generated file is in <code>src/theme/teal</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did all the styling for the navbar and text manually in
      <code>public/appbar.css</code> just to be safe
    </p>
    <h2>3: Use</h2>
    <p>
      The file manager is the first icon, and has the upload and download
      functionality. Upload immediately uploads your file and adds it to the
      list of available files.
    </p>
    <p>
      The save dialog is the floppy disc icon second from the left. Files are
      stored flat in the same folder. After saving a file is available to
      download or reopen from the file manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      Undo and redo for coloring is based on strokes. Undoing will move back to
      the point at which the current click began.
    </p>
    <h3>Bugs</h3>

    <p>
      I can't figure out why the color input calls it's onChange every time the
      color gets changed. I was under the impression that onChange should only
      happen when select is hit and onInput was for all changes, but they seem
      to both be the same on my machine on ff and chrome. This means that
      hitting undo will undo a single step of the color change, and if you drag
      the cursor around each step will add a new color to be undone, which adds
      up quickly. I recommend either clicking carefully or just entering in a
      value. I think this still fits within the assignment spec, but it's
      annoying and caught me off guard.
    </p>

    <p>
      It doesn't scale that well in super low height windows, but I don't think
      the window is useable at that scale either way. Can't really solve it
      without measuring things in js, and I don't want to do that.
